🧑‍🎓 I'm a final year master student at [Peking University, School of Mathematical Sciences](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn). Majoring in Applied Mathematics under the supervision of [Prof. Jinwen Ma]((https://english.pku.edu.cn/)).

🧐 My research interest lies in using AI technology to solve real-world problems, particularly in the applications of multimodal learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

📑 I'am currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of developing a unified multi-modal large model that integrates geometry diagram generation, problem-solving, and diagram understanding.

🥊🏋️ I am also interested in doing sports.  I do <a href="/images/boxing.png">boxing</a> and <a href="/images/weight.png">crossfit</a>.

# Selected Experience
### **Diagram Formalization Enhanced Geometry Problem Solver**

[Project Homepage](https://github.com/zezeze97/DFE-GPS) | [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JO-KU/SynthGeo228K) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04214)  
- Designed a multimodal framework integrating visual features and geometric formal languages for solving complex geometry problems.  
- Proposed a synthetic data approach (SynthGeo228K dataset) for improving model training and diagram interpretation.  
- Expanded applications of MLLMs to handle open-ended geometry problem-solving, leveraging GPT-4o-mini for reasoning assessment.
