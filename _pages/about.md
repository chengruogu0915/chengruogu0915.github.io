🧑‍🎓 I'm a final year master student at Peking Univeristy, School of Mathematical Sciences.

🧐 My research interests are in making MLLMs to reason.

📑 I'am currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of AR in geometry.

🥊🏋️🏐 I am also interested in doing sports.

# Selected Experience

### **Diagram Formalization Enhanced Geometry Problem Solver**  
![pipeline](/images/pipeline.png)  
- Designed a multimodal framework integrating visual features and geometric formal languages for solving complex geometry problems.  
- Proposed a synthetic data approach (SynthGeo228K dataset) for improving model training and diagram interpretation.  
- Expanded applications of MLLMs to handle open-ended geometry problem-solving, leveraging GPT-4o-mini for reasoning assessment.
