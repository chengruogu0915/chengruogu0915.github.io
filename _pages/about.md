🧑‍🎓 I will begin my PhD in the [Natural Language Processing (NLP) group](https://sheffield.ac.uk/cs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) at the [University of Sheffield](https://sheffield.ac.uk/) in February 2026, under the supervision of [Dr. Marco Valentino](https://www.marcovalentino.net/) and [Prof. Nikolaos Aletras](https://nikosaletras.com/).

I obtained my master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from the [School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn), where I was supervised by [Prof. Jinwen Ma](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/jwma/homepage/).

🧐 My research interests include multimodal reasoning and Large Language Model applications.

😄 I am from Taichung, Taiwan and grew up in Beijing.

🥊🏋️ I am interested in doing sports.  I do <a href="/images/boxing.png">boxing</a> and <a href="/images/weight.png">crossfit</a>.

</p>

- Proposed the first unified multi-modal geometry expert model, GeoUni,capable of solving geometry problems, generating precise geometric diagrams using both formal and natural language, and creating geometry problems based
on knowledge points. 
- Proposed Geo-MAGVIT, a module specifically designed for the tokenization of geometric diagrams. By introducing topo-structural awareness loss and text region loss, it significantly improves the precision of geometry structure and text reconstruction.
- Combined GRPO and LoRA to train the Geo-Reasoning-Adapter, which effectively boosts geometric reasoning capability and seamlessly integrates into the unified model architecture.
- Established a novel diagram generation evaluation metrics, which includes the Geometry Semantic Matching Scores (GSMSs) and Geometry Pixel Matching Score (GPMS) to comprehensively evaluate the diagram generation task.

</p>

- Designed a multimodal framework integrating visual features and geometric formal languages for solving complex geometry problems.  
- Proposed a synthetic data approach (SynthGeo228K dataset) for improving model training and diagram interpretation.  
- Achieved an accuracy of 82.38% on the publicly available FormalGeo7k dataset, significantly outperforming existing multi-modal and language models, including GPT-4.
