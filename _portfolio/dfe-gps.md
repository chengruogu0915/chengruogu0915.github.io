Mathematical reasoning remains an ongoing challenge for AI models, especially for geometry problems, which require both linguistic and visual signals. As the vision encoders of most MLLMs are trained on natural scenes, they often struggle to understand geometric diagrams, performing no better in geometry problem-solving than LLMs that only process text. This limitation is further amplified by the
lack of effective methods for representing geometric relationships. To address these issues, we introduce the Diagram Formalization Enhanced Geometry Problem Solver (DFE-GPS), a new framework that integrates visual features, geometric formal language, and natural language representations. Specifically, we propose a novel synthetic data approach and construct a large-scale geometric dataset, SynthGeo228K, annotated with formal and natural language captions, designed to enhance the vision encoder to understand geometric structures better. Our framework improves MLLMsâ€™ ability to process geometric diagrams and extends their application to open-ended tasks on the formalgeo7k dataset.
