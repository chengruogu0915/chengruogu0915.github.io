[Project Homepage](https://github.com/zezeze97/DFE-GPS) | [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JO-KU/SynthGeo228K) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04214) | [Video](https://youtu.be/kI6_DDXweWE?si=q6kwaekFNJjUinyD)
- Designed a multimodal framework integrating visual features and geometric formal languages for solving complex geometry problems.  
- Proposed a synthetic data approach (SynthGeo228K dataset) for improving model training and diagram interpretation.  
- Achieved an accuracy of 82.38% on the publicly available FormalGeo7k dataset, significantly outperforming existing multi-modal and language models, including GPT-4.
