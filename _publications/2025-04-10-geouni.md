We propose **GeoUni**, a unified multi-modal geometry expert model that can:

- Solve geometry problems
- Generate precise geometric diagrams using both formal and natural language
- Construct new geometry problems based on knowledge points

Key contributions:

- **Geo-MAGVIT**: A tokenization module for geometric diagrams, enhancing structure and text accuracy with topo-structural awareness loss and text region loss.
- **Geo-Reasoning-Adapter**: Combines GRPO and LoRA to enhance reasoning and integrate seamlessly into the architecture.
- New evaluation metrics: **GSMS (Geometry Semantic Matching Score)** and **GPMS (Geometry Pixel Matching Score)** to assess diagram generation quality.
